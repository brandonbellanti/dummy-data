    "## Introduction\n",
    "On Friday, February 5th, 2021, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell released a documentary titled _Absolute Proof_ with claims about foreign interference in the 2020 United States General Election. The video restates earlier claims made by Lindell and others, but also introduces a new claim based on \"terabytes\" of data purportedly collected by \"cybersecurity experts\" in the days surrounding the election on November 3rd, 2020. Lindell and one of the contributors, Mary Fanning, point to this new data as \"100% proof\" of election fraud. There are no details given as to the identity of these \"experts\" or the source from which or methods by which this data was collected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with basing conclusions about election fraud on this \"evidence\" is that this sort of data is incredibly easy to fake. The code in this notebook demonstrates how. The code and related explanations are written to (hopefully!) be understood by anyone, you don't necessarily need to know the specific coding techniques to see what is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "**To be clear, I am not claiming the data shown in _Absolute Proof_ was fake.** That claim would be as conspiratorial as the claims that the documentary itself makes about election fraud. My point in this excerise is that without any explaination of the data's source or method of collection, the data alone cannot be trusted. Not that their data is *fake*, but that their data is *not credible*."

    "## Getting started\n",
    "First things first. The code included in this notebook is Python 3. To start, I import some functions from already existing Python libraries. This simply means I don't have to write all of my code from scratch. I'll use already existing functions for picking random numbers and items from lists and for reading and writing CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a related note, for anyone familiar with Python or programming in general, this code is optimized for readability, not concision or speed. My goal is to show people unfamiliar with code how easy it is to generate data that looks real but is actually completely made up."

    "Now to the good stuff. The way you generate a lot of data very quickly is to write functions, or small pieces of code you can reuse over and over again.

    "The timestamp format in _Absolute Proof_ is `mm/dd/yyyy HH:MM:SS`. To generate a fake timestamp, I need to generate each component part. The month and year are easy: 11 and 2020 respectively. For each of the other values, I just need to generate a random number based on what the range of numbers would be; for example, the hour must be from 0 to 24, since the data in the video was based on 24-hour time. For the day, I will start with the 1st of the month based on the commentary in the video and go until the 5th, but this end date is arbitrary. Once I have all of the pieces, I can combine them into a single timestamp."

It is worth noting that in the data shown on the screen in _Absolute Proof_, there are records that show the actor was unsuccessful in gaining access, yet show that votes were changed, which is completely inconsistent. The values shown are Y, N, U, or blank: presumably for yes, no, unsure/unclear, or no data respectively. Again, generating this dummy data is a simple random choice from items in a list."
